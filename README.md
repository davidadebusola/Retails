# Retail-Dataset

## Project Overview
This data aims to determine the profitability of various products and identify the most frequent buyers.

## Data Source
This dataset was obtained from Kaggle.

## Tools
Power Query PowerBi Excel Spreadsheet

## Data cleaning
Data cleaning was performed through these steps:

1. Changing data type
2. Perfomed conditional columns
3. Some columns were renamed

## Data Analysis
1. What is the count of customers?
2. Products with the most profit.
3. Age and gender that buys the most.
4. Products bought the most.


## Finding and Result
1. This dataset consists of 1000 customers with 490 males and 510 females.
2. Electronics had themost profit followed by clothing and then beauty.
3. Age and gender that bought the most were the older males followed by the middle aged women and then the younger males. I created a conditional column where: old= 41+, middle aged= 26+ and young= 25 and below.
4. Clothing was the product bought the most followed by electronics and beauty.

## Recommendation
I have no recommendations as this work was done primarily for research purposes and I encountered no errors.
